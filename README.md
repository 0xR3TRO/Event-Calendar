## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores data related to events, including:

- **Events:** Information about the title, date, time, description, and location of the event.
- **Notifications:** Data about reminder settings for each event.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure, where:

- **Model:** Handles the logic for managing events and notifications.
- **View:** Presents the user interface.
- **Controller:** Manages communication between the model and the view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js).
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express), MongoDB (database).
- **Notifications:** External services such as Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for emails.

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files:_ Separate files for event management logic, user interface, notification management.
- _Coding Styles:_ Use of modularity, readability, and comments in the code.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Verify the correctness of event addition and editing functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure components work correctly together.
- **User Interface Tests:** Check user interactions on various devices.
- **Performance Tests:** Evaluate the application's performance under different loads.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop a set of test cases for each function of the application.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing found bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, fixing, publishing on platforms available to users.
- **Deadlines:** Define dates for planned deployment stages.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establish communication channels for users to report issues.
- **Updates:** Plan regular updates based on user needs and feedback.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:** Divide work into specific tasks (e.g., implementation of addition, editing, testing functions).
- **Deadlines:** Define the time required for each stage.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Based on hours worked or developer team.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, potential external service fees, technical support.
